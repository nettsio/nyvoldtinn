    <h1>The brass horses from Etne</h1>

  <p>Three detector finds from Etne form an unusually rare and intriguing collection. They are three small copper-alloy horse figures from the Middle Ages, discovered in different places around the village. In their own time, they were referred to as messinghestar (“brass horses”). Written sources describe various uses for them over several centuries. Individual finds are known from neighboring countries, but the main concentration of finds is in Eastern Norway, especially around Oslo. Discovering three of them in the Etne area is very unusual, and makes us wonder why they ended up here in particular.

    <h2>Engehesten</h2>

    <p>The largest of the three was found at Enge in 2011. It bears two stamps: a crown on its neck and an “O” on its rump. These are likely verification marks, suggesting that the horse was used as a weight. Such figures are often referred to as weight horses. This one weighs 47 grams and may have represented a two-øre weight (a quarter of a mark). King Håkon V (1270–1319) is credited with standardizing the Norwegian system of weights, and horses of this type are often attributed to his reign. The figure has been on display at the Bryggen Museum in Bergen.

    <h2>Sæbøhesten</h2>

    <p>The middle horse was found at Sæbø in 2022. It has a saddle, which is common on many messinghestar (brass horses). Finding one out in the middle of a field brings to mind the stories of how people believed these horses had magical properties. Among other things, they could be hung around the necks of sick animals to provide health and protection. Did the string around the cow’s neck break? Or was a trade taking place here, and the horse, which now weighs 35 grams, used as a 3/2-øre weight?

    <h2>Stødlehesten</h2>

    <p>The smallest horse was found at Stødle in 2020. Nearby lay the royal estate where the national ruler Erling Skakke came from. Perhaps it was his son, King Magnus (born 1156), who played with this horse as a child? In Víga-Glúms saga, we hear of two boys who had a brass horse as a toy. This saga was written in the 13th century, but the story it tells dates back to the 10th century. The Stødle horse weighs 24 grams – which could correspond to a one-øre weight.

According to folklore, brass horses were believed to bring anything from good luck to ill fortune. They could serve as net weights to ensure a good catch, or be placed in the sea to spoil fishing. We cannot say for certain what the Etne horses were used for, other than the stamps on the largest one, which indicate trade. That Etne held significance before and during the Middle Ages is known from the sagas, and these horses remain tangible reminders of the past and of the village’s connections with other regions.</p>
